Overview:
Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm which is based on divide and conquer algorithm. This algorithm works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements or re arrange the array into two sub-arrays such that each element in the left sub-array is less than or equal to the pivot element and each element in right sub-array is larger than the pivot element.
Quicksort is a reliable general purpose sorting algorithm and in this project we can sort an array of elements using the assembly language using quick sort. Quick sort is a widely used sorting algorithm known for its efficiency, with an average time complexity of O(n log n) and can be used for large data sets. The implementation is a good choice for programmers.
In this project, we use Quick Sort algorithm using Assembly Language on a list of arrays in the 8085 Microprocessor which was designed by Intel in 1977. It is an 8-bit microprocessor based on NMOS technology. . It features a 16-bit address bus, an 8-bit data bus, and registers including A, B, C, D, E, H, as well as 16-bit registers SP (Stack Pointer) and PC (Program Counter). 
Operating at a clock speed of 3 MHz and supporting a memory addressing range of 64K, the 8085 microprocessors has been used in various applications, including early personal computers, embedded systems, and household appliances like washing machines, microwave ovens, and gadgets.
